# Brief methodology

The methodology used for this report is based on the Office for National Statistics' methodology for the Wealth in Great Britain National Statistics publication series^[ONS Wealth in Great Britain report: [`r str_wrap("https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/totalwealthingreatbritain/april2016tomarch2018", 70)`](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/totalwealthingreatbritain/april2016tomarch2018)]. Further detail on methodology can be found on ONS's webpages.

### The Wealth and Assets Survey

The analysis in this report is based on data from the Wealth and Assets Survey (WAS), which is a valuable source of information on the economic well-being of households in Great Britain. WAS is managed by the Office for National Statistics.

The survey has a large sample size and almost complete coverage of Great Britain. The sample of private households in Scotland however excludes households north of the Caledonian Canal and the Scottish islands. While there are some estimated numbers of households in Scotland included, it should be noted that these numbers are for illustrative purposes only, and may not necessarily be representative of households north of the Caledonian Canal and on the Scottish islands.

WAS is a sample survey and any numbers shown here are estimates only and could be slightly higher or lower if we interviewed a different sample of the population. 

### Change of survey period

Data is collected over waves of two years, with the first wave data collected between July 2006 to June 2008. The survey period changed from a June-July pattern to an April-March pattern in 2014. Therefore, estimates for 2012-2014 and for 2014-2016 are both based on data from a partially overlapping time period (April to June 2014). 

The latest estimates are based on data collected from April 2016 to March 2018.

### Inflation adjustment

Wealth estimates and income estimates have been deflated to April 2016 to March 2018 prices using the Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiersâ€™ housing costs (CPIH). The table below shows the deflators used for each period.

### Income equivalisation
