Contains the R Markdown code for the Wealth and Assets in Scotland 2006-2018 report at [http://www.wealthandassets.scot/2020report.html](http://www.wealthandassets.scot/2020report.html).

Notes:
- the datasets required to produce the charts and tables are not included in this repository
- when building the website, the main file (2020report.Rmd) needed to be renamed to index.Rmd
